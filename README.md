# MX Master 3S Profiles for Logi Options+
Just my personal profiles for my Logitech MX Master 3s via Logi Options+ software. If you have any suggestions for what I should change, please make a GitHub Issue for it with the tag of `Enhancement`.

More binds will be added eventually, I just need to learn this program more and find what I should make more efficient with this mouse.

### This repo will be screenshots only
I've been trying to figure out how Logi Options+ stores the per app configurations, but it seems to be all in 1 JSON file that's over 300kb and thousands of lines long. I don't like that, so I'm not going to upload that, and just provide screenshots instead.

Gross coporate company, please be gone, additionally, **please** go bankrupt, I don't like you. ‚ù§

### [Photoshop CC 2023](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop)
This one is really just the default official integration between Options+ <-> Photoshop, might be gone in a few months since I despise Adobe.

## [Affinity Suite v2](https://affinity.serif.com/) [based]
Serif truly makes great products, amazing alternatives to the Adobe Suite, would higher recommend!

### [Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/), [Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/), and [Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/publisher/) [all the same binds]

## [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
Great 3D program, I just need to learn it more. I use the Steam version, functionally identical to the official builds, just the Steam version has time tracking [help I have 600+ hours in it].
### [3.5 [really for any Blender 3.x version]](https://www.blender.org/download/)
This one I'm unsure about for the sole reason of `I don't know what I should bind to my mouse for Blender`, I need to use the software more and go `which would be more convinent to bind to my mouse` a lot more. For now, this is a bad mix. Please suggest in GitHub Issues.

### [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
